- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @XploreXing
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in reading, cooking, workingâ€“out in the gym. I'm quite a foodie and a coffee lover.
- ðŸ‘€ As a lifelong learner with a background in translation and interpretation, I have always embraced challenges, from mastering simultaneous interpretation to transitioning into the tech field. I am exploring my own unique way to combine linguistic skills with tech, hope one day I can figure it out.
